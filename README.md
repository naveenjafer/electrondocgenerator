# electrondocgenerator
A Repo to build a tool that can generate a completions.json for Electron documentation to help in atom-autocomplete-api package.

The files.json file is to generate all the methods use in electron from the documentation. Place this file in the electron/docs/api folder and install the dependencies locally and run using node. Work is being done to structurize how the completions.json file should look like and then these contents will be added to a file.
